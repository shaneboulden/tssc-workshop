title: Detecting supply-chain compromise at runtime
exercise: 4

summary: "In this exercise we'll identify anomalous behaviours in container applications at runtime, that could be indicative of supply-chain compromise."
---
Throughout this workshop we've looked at how to build signing and verification into the software supply-chain. We've looked at using the capabilities provided by the Sigstore project to cryptographically sign container images, and verify signatures and build actions using the Rekor transparency log. We've also seen how to build container signing into software pipelines with Tekton Chains.

Digital signing and verification is an important supply-chain security control, and so is runtime monitoring. Runtime anomaly detection and response allows us to identify supply-chain compromise from the output of a build-chain - identifying how an application behaves, and detecting and responding to anopmalous activity.

In this lab we'll identify anomalous behaviours in container applications at runtime that could be indicative of supply-chain compromise. We'll do this using the extended berkeley packet filter (eBPF)-based runtime monitoring supported by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS).

## Cleanup existing policies
Log in to ACS Central and select `Platform configuration -> Policy management`. Firstly we need to disable the policy from the last exercise. 

Select the `Cosign verification - userX` policy. Select `Actions` and select `Disable policy`.

## Clone an existing policy
Navigate back to the list of policies and perform a search for `Policy: crypto`. You should see policies related to `Cryptomining` shown.

<Zoom>
![runtime2](/static/images/exercise4/runtime2.png)
</Zoom>

Select the menu next to the `Cryptocurrency Mining Process Execution` policy and select `Clone policy`. You'll be shown a new copy of the policy.

<Zoom>

</Zoom>

<Zoom>
![runtime4](/static/images/exercise4/runtime4.png)
</Zoom>

Name the new policy `Cryptocurrency Mining Process Execution - userX`. Select `Next`, and under `Policy behavior` ensure that `Runtime` is selected. Change the `Response method` from `Inform` to `Inform and Enforce`, and click the switch for `Enforce on Runtime`.

Select `Next` until you reach `Policy scope`. Select `Add Inclusion Scope` and create an inclusive scope for your individual project.

</Zoom>

Select `Review policy` and `Save`. You should now see the new policy created. If it's disabled, enable the policy.

## Test out the new runtime policy
Navigate back to OpenShift and your individual user project. Select the `+` button to create a new deployment in the current namespace (shown in yellow).

<Zoom>
![ocp1](/static/images/exercise4/ocp1.png)
</Zoom>

Enter the following YAML to create a new deployment:
```yaml
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-app
  labels:
    app: demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/component: demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/name: demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: demo-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: demo-app
          image: quay.io/smileyfritz/demo-app:v0.1.1
```

</Zoom>

Select `Create` and observe that this time the container starts deploying.

<Zoom>
![deploy1](/static/images/exercise4/deploy1.png)
</Zoom>

If you select `Pods` you'll see the pod name cycling through, but the container never deploys successfully.

<Zoom>
![deploy2](/static/images/exercise4/deploy2.png)
</Zoom>

If you select `Events` for the deployment you will see the reason - this container image contains a cryptominer!

<Zoom>
![events1](/static/images/exercise4/events1.png)
</Zoom>

Navigate back to ACS and select `Violations`. You should see a policy violation for `Cryptocurrency Mining Process Execution - userX`.

<Zoom>
![violation1](/static/images/exercise4/violation1.png)
</Zoom>

Selecting the violation shows the process that was detected inside the container at runtime.

<Zoom>
![violation2](/static/images/exercise4/violation2.png)
</Zoom>

If you select `Enforcement` you can see the action that was taken. In this case, the pod was immediately killed as soon as the cryptominer was detected.

## Cleanup
Navigate back to OpenShift and your user project. Delete the `demo-app` deployment in your namespace.

## Stretch goal
Can you lock-down the application, so that *nothing* run except for the `httpd` process?
- How can you identify the process baseline for an application?
- How can you **lock** the process baseline for a deployment?
- How do you notify security teams / take action when anomalous processes are detected inside running containers?
