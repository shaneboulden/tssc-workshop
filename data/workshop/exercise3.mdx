title: Blocking unsigned container images with ACS
exercise: 3
date: '2023-09-20'
tags: ['sigstore','cosign','openshift','acs','chains']

authors: ['default']
summary: "In the third exercise we'll block unsigned containers from OpenShift"
---
So far we've signed container images with Sigstore, and injected cryprtographic signing and attestation build pipelines on OpenShift with Tekton Chains.

In both these exercises we manually verified container signatures using `cosign` and `rekor-cli`. This is effective, but security teams need an automated way of verifying signatures. Every time a user tries to deploy a container image, we should check that it is signed by an appropriate key, and if not, block the image from the platform.

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) provides an admission controller that supports this workflow. Once deployed to OpenShift, the RHACS admission controller verifies container images before deployment. If they are unsigned, it can block the image, or scale the deployment replicas to 'zero', effectively preventing the untrusted container image running on the platform. These activities are all recorded and audited, and can be sent to security information and event management (SIEM) platforms for further investigation and correlation.

In this lab we'll block unsigned container images using the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) Cosign admission controller integration.

## Create a signature integration
Login to Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS). 

Once you're logged in, select `Platform Configuration -> Integrations`, and find the `Signature` integration.

<Zoom>
![acs2](/static/images/exercise3/acs2.png)
</Zoom>

Create a new Signature integration named `cosign - userX`, where `userX` is your workshop username.

<Zoom>
![acs3](/static/images/exercise3/acs3.png)
</Zoom>

Collect the public key from OpenShift and add it to the Cosign integration.
```bash
oc get secret signing-secrets \
  -n openshift-pipelines \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.cosign\.pub}' | base64 --decode
```
<Zoom>
![acs4](/static/images/exercise3/acs4.png)
</Zoom>

Select save.

## Create a policy
Select `Platform Configuration -> Policy Management`. Select `Create Policy` to bring up a new policy.

<Zoom>
![acs5](/static/images/exercise3/acs5.png)
</Zoom>

Name the new policy `Cosign verification - userX`. Give it a severity of `Medium`, and select `Kubernetes` from the Categories. You don't need to add anything for the description, rationale or guidance, but you can complete these sections if you'd like.

<Zoom>
![acs6](/static/images/exercise3/acs6.png)
</Zoom>

Select `Next` and select `Deploy` for the lifecycle stage. 

![acs deploy](/static/images/exercise3/deploy.png)

Select `Inform and enforce` for the Response Method, and select the switch to `Enforce on Deploy`.

<Zoom>
![acs7](/static/images/exercise3/acs7.png)
</Zoom>

Select `Next` and drag `Image signature` from the column on the right into the Policy criteria. 

<Zoom>
![acs8](/static/images/exercise3/acs8.png)
</Zoom>

Click the `Select` button in the policy and select the Cosign integration that you created earlier. Select `Save`.

<Zoom>
![acs9](/static/images/exercise3/acs9.png)
</Zoom>

Select `Next` and under `Restrict by scope` select `Add Inclusion Scope`. Select the available cluster, and enter your user project for the namespace. e.g. _userX_.

<Zoom>
![acs10](/static/images/exercise3/acs10.png)
</Zoom>

Select `Next`. Review the policy and select `Save`.

<Zoom>
![acs11](/static/images/exercise3/acs11.png)
</Zoom>

## Test out the policy
Navigate back to OpenShift and your project (e.g. _userX_). Click the `+` button (shown in yellow) to create a new deployment.

<Zoom>
![ocp1](/static/images/exercise3/ocp1.png)
</Zoom>

Paste the following YAML into the dialog and select `Create`.
```yaml
apiVersion : apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: demo-app
  labels:
    app: demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/component: demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/name: demo-app
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: demo-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: demo-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: demo-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: demo-app
          image: quay.io/smileyfritz/demo-app:v0.1.1
```
<Zoom>
![ocp2](/static/images/exercise3/ocp2.png)
</Zoom>

Verify that the ACS policy has blocked the new deployment.

<Zoom>
![ocp3](/static/images/exercise3/ocp3.png)
</Zoom>

Navigate back to ACS and select `Violations`. Verify that you can now see a new violation has been created for the `Cosign verification - userX` policy.

<Zoom>
![ocp4](/static/images/exercise3/ocp4.png)
</Zoom>

You can select the Cosign verification violation and see more details about the container image and the actions taken to enforce the policy.

## Stretch goal
How can you integrate your `Cosign verification` policy into the CI/CD pipeline you created in Exercise 2? 
- Are there any changes you need to make to the pipeline?
- Are there any changes you need to make to the policy?
