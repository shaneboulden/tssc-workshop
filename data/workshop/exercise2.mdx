summary: "In the second exercise we'll sign a container image with Tekton Chains."
---
In the last exercise we signed a container image using Sigstore keyless signing services. This provides a simple way of signing container image, but it can be clunky for developers to step through each time they need to sign a new software release.

[Tekton Chains](https://tekton.dev/docs/chains/) allows you to build Sigstore signing into Tekton pipelines, and is built-in to Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines. Chains works by observing all TaskRuns executions in your cluster. When TaskRuns complete, Chains takes a snapshot of them. Chains then converts this snapshot to one or more standard payload formats, signs them and stores them somewhere.

Some of the current features of Tekton Chains include:
- Signing Tekton TaskRun results with user provided cryptographic keys, including TaskRuns themselves and OCI Images
- Attestation formats like [intoto](https://github.com/tektoncd/chains/tree/main/docs/intoto.md)
- Signing with a variety of cryptographic key types and services (x509, KMS)
- Support for multiple storage backends for signatures

In this lab we'll sign a container image with Tekton Chains and Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines, push this to a container registry, and then validate the attestations created about the container image and verify the container signatures.

## Lab environment
Navigate to your project and find the `tssc-terminal` container. Create a terminal session within OpenShift:

<Zoom>
![terminal](/static/images/terminal.png)
</Zoom>

Login to the registry using your lab credentials:
```bash
podman login -u tssc -p $(oc whoami -t) registry.blueradish.net
```
Set the project for your username:
```bash
oc project $(oc whoami | cut -d : -f 3)
```
Copy the example image into your own container registry account:
```bash
OC_PROJECT=$(oc project -q)

podman pull \
  quay.io/smileyfritz/chat-client:latest

podman tag \
  quay.io/smileyfritz/chat-client:latest \
  registry.blueradish.net/$OC_PROJECT/chat-client:latest

podman push \
  registry.blueradish.net/$OC_PROJECT/chat-client:latest
```

Create a new application from the new image:
```bash
OC_PROJECT=$(oc project -q)

oc new-app \
  registry.blueradish.net/$OC_PROJECT/chat-client:latest
```
## Create the pipeline secrets
Create a secret for the registry configuration:
```bash
oc create secret generic regcred \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=~/.config/containers/auth.json \
  --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
```
Navigate to the RHACS URL (from Etherpad) and login using your OpenShift user credentials.

<Zoom>
![acs_login1](/static/images/exercise2/acs_login1.png)
</Zoom>

<Zoom>
![acs_login2](/static/images/exercise2/acs_login2.png)
</Zoom>

<Zoom>
![acs_login3](/static/images/exercise2/acs_login3.png)
</Zoom>

When prompted, select `Allow selected permissions` and you will be shown the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) dashboard.

![acs_login4](/static/images/exercise2/acs_login4.png)
</Zoom>

<Zoom>
![acs_login5](/static/images/exercise2/acs_login5.png)
</Zoom>

Select `Platform configuration -> Integrations` from the left-hand menu. Scroll to the bottom of the page and find `StackRox API tokens`.

<Zoom>
![api1](/static/images/exercise2/api1.png)
</Zoom>

Create a token for your username. For the role, select `Continuous Integration`.

<Zoom>
![api2](/static/images/exercise2/api2.png)
</Zoom>

Once complete select `Generate`.

Copy the API token and create a new secret:
```bash
oc create secret generic acstoken \
  --from-literal=token=<your-token-here>
```

## Create the pipeline
Change into the `pipeline` directory and inspect the resources:
```bash
cd /pipeline
ls -l
```
There's a few changes that you need to make to this pipeline configuration. Firstly, open the `pipeline-run-with-scan.yaml` file with one of the available text editors (`vim` or `nano`):
```bash
vim pipeline-run-with-scan.yaml 
```
Update the following parameters:

* `image-name`: Update this to reflect the internal registry and your current namespace. e.g. `registry.blueradish.net/userX/chat-client:latest`
* `acs-scan-api`: Update this to the route for ACS, e.g. central-acs-central.apps.vlme6l1rt1709976be.australiasoutheast.aroapp.io

Once you've made these changes, create all the resources in the `pipeline/deploy` directory:
```bash
cd pipeline
oc create -f /pipeline/deploy/
```

## Run the pipeline
Let's set a few permissions and run the pipeline:
```bash
OC_PROJECT=$(oc project -q) 

oc adm policy add-role-to-user isview \
  -z pipeline-svc \
  --role-namespace=$OC_PROJECT \
  -n $OC_PROJECT

oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \
  -z pipeline-svc
```
Now start the pipeline:
```bash
oc create -f pipeline-run-with-scan.yaml
```
You should now be able to navigate to `Pipeline` in the OpenShift UI and see the pipeline running:

<Zoom>
![pipeline1](/static/images/exercise2/pipeline1.png)
</Zoom>

## Verify the container signatures and tlog entry

Once the pipeline completes Tekton Chains will automatically ensure that the image signing is performed. Chains observes all PipelineRuns in the cluster. When it observes a PipelineRun complete that emits image and digest results, it automatically signs those artifacts and generates attestations from the pipeline, and creates a Rekor entry for the container image build.

Now that our container image has been signed by Tekton Chains, let's verify the signatures and artifacts created. Navigate back to the terminal window and check that you can verify the container image with `cosign`.

Firstly, login to the internal registry:
```bash
podman login -u tssc -p $(oc whoami -t) registry.blueradish.net
```
Now verify the container signature:
```bash
OC_PROJECT=$(oc project -q)

cosign verify \
  --key k8s://openshift-pipelines/signing-secrets \
  registry.blueradish.net/$OC_PROJECT/chat-client:latest
```
If everything ran successfully, you should see that the cosign claims are valid:
```
Verification for quay.io/smileyfritz/chat-client:latest --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - The claims were present in the transparency log
  - The signatures were integrated into the transparency log when the certificate was valid
  - The signatures were verified against the specified public key

[{"critical":{"identity":{"docker-reference":"registry.blueradish.net/user1/chat-client"},"image":{"docker-manifest-digest":"sha256:0be008b5cdaafa8b0b600f89f7524e2126c18e92f7c5b6a73aadccd2af413581"},"type":"cosign container image signature"},"optional":null}]
```
You can also verify that an attestation has also been created and signed. Firstly, we need the digest of the container image that was just created:
```bash
OC_PROJECT=$(oc project -q)

crane digest registry.blueradish.net/$OC_PROJECT/chat-client:latest
```
Now you can perform a search using `rekor-cli` for this digest:
```bash
OC_PROJECT=$(oc project -q)

# Generate the SHA digest of the 'latest' version of the container image
IMAGE_SHA=$(crane digest registry.blueradish.net/$OC_PROJECT/chat-client:latest)

# Search Rekor for UUID using the SHA digest and set it as an environment variable
export UUID=$(rekor-cli search --sha=$IMAGE_SHA)
```
Check that you got a record from the `rekor` transparency log:
```bash
echo $UUID
```
Finally, grab the attestation that was created by Tekton Chains and take a look at the output:
```bash
rekor-cli get --uuid $UUID --format json | jq -r .Attestation | jq
```
You'll be able to see the attestation that Tekton Chains created during the build step of the pipeline:
```json
{
  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1",
  "predicateType": "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2",
  "subject": [
    {
      "name": "registry.blueradish.net/user1/chat-client",
      "digest": {
        "sha256": "a1a783df5746d9eaa75decb3feb75c4fec8d4b26ccac590642c1daee3ac78fcc"
      }
    }
  ],
  "predicate": {
    "builder": {
      "id": "https://tekton.dev/chains/v2"
    },
    "buildType": "tekton.dev/v1beta1/TaskRun",
    ...
  }
}
```
## Stretch goal
Can you combine the image `build` and `scan` into a single step?
- Take a look at the attestation created by Tekton Chains - what extra information is included?
- What happens if the container image scan fails. Is the image still signed?
